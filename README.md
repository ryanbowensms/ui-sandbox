# Sandbox UI

This sandbox is here for the development team to experiment with SASS and BEM methodology. It demonstrates a sass project structure. It uses a simple Gulp build system to compile SASS files, utilising Autoprefixer to add vendor prefixes and Browser Sync to live reload the site.

## install dependencies
run ```npm i ```

you might need to install gulp and gulp cli globally if you haven't already

run ```npm i -g gulp``` + ```npm i -g gulp-cli```

## compile sass and watch changes + reload 
run ```gulp```

## measure output CSS with Parker
run ```gulp parker```
